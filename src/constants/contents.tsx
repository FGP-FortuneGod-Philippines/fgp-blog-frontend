  Chairman’s Message

  As Chairman of FortuneGod Group of Companies ., I am honored to
  share our journey, vision, and enduring commitment with you.
  
  From our roots in Taiwan to our decades of presence in the
  Philippines, FortuneGod has always believed that business is not only
  about trade—it is about building bridges, empowering communities, and
  creating shared prosperity. Today, as we expand our footprint across
  Asia-Pacific through cross-border trade, e-commerce, and sustainable
  development, this belief guides everything we do.

  In launching ShoPilipinas, our localized e-commerce ecosystem,
  we are not only opening new markets but also providing Philippine
  entrepreneurs with tools, access, and opportunities to compete
  globally. By integrating AI-driven commerce, innovative supply chains,
  and a membership-based economy, we aim to redefine the way businesses
  and consumers connect, making global trade more inclusive, efficient,
  and rewarding.

  Yet, our mission extends beyond commerce. We recognize our
  responsibility to the environment and society. That is why we actively
  invest in renewable energy, waste-to energy projects, and sustainable
  infrastructure—because true prosperity must be aligned with the
  well-being of future generations.

  At FortuneGod, our strength lies in partnerships—with
  governments, enterprises, and communities. Together, we can achieve
  more than any of us could alone. I invite you to walk with us as we
  create not only a profitable business model but also a platform for
  long-term growth, innovation, and positive impact across the region.

  On behalf of the entire FortuneGod family, I thank you for your
  trust and support. The journey ahead is filled with opportunities, and
  we are committed to seizing them with integrity, professionalism, and
  an unwavering vision for the future.
