          Chairman’s Message <br />
          <br /> As Chairman of FortuneGod Group of Companies ., I am honored to
          share our journey, vision, and enduring commitment with you. <br />
          <br /> From our roots in Taiwan to our decades of presence in the
          Philippines, FortuneGod has always believed that business is not only
          about trade—it is about building bridges, empowering communities, and
          creating shared prosperity. Today, as we expand our footprint across
          Asia-Pacific through cross-border trade, e-commerce, and sustainable
          development, this belief guides everything we do. <br />
          <br /> In launching ShoPilipinas, our localized e-commerce ecosystem,
          we are not only opening new markets but also providing Philippine
          entrepreneurs with tools, access, and opportunities to compete
          globally. By integrating AI-driven commerce, innovative supply chains,
          and a membership-based economy, we aim to redefine the way businesses
          and consumers connect, making global trade more inclusive, efficient,
          and rewarding. <br />
          <br /> Yet, our mission extends beyond commerce. We recognize our
          responsibility to the environment and society. That is why we actively
          invest in renewable energy, waste-to energy projects, and sustainable
          infrastructure—because true prosperity must be aligned with the
          well-being of future generations. <br />
          <br /> At FortuneGod, our strength lies in partnerships—with
          governments, enterprises, and communities. Together, we can achieve
          more than any of us could alone. I invite you to walk with us as we
          create not only a profitable business model but also a platform for
          long-term growth, innovation, and positive impact across the region.{" "}
          <br />
          <br /> On behalf of the entire FortuneGod family, I thank you for your
          trust and support. The journey ahead is filled with opportunities, and
          we are committed to seizing them with integrity, professionalism, and
          an unwavering vision for the future. <br />
          <br /> David Huang <br />
          Chairman <br />
          FortuneGod Group of Companies
